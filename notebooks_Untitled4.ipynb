This means that\n    if we were to repeat this study many times and calculate the 99% confidence interval each time,\n    99% of the time the interval would contain the true population proportion.\n\n    Another way to interpret the confidence interval is to say that we are 99% confident that\n    the true population proportion is within 1.6 percentage points of the sample proportion of 52%.\n    \n    ",
